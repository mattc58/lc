I even bought a house! During college, I racked up a few grand in credit card debt, and I've just never really been able to get ahead of it thanks to lots of bills and also high interest rates (15.9%!). One of my projects lately has been to get control of my funds and set up different accounts so that I can get the best &quot;bang for my buck,&quot; so to speak, so Mint.com pointed me toward this site as a good way to pay off my credit card debt at a lower interest rate. <br/><br/>To make you feel good about lending to me: I have never been late on any payments, and the idea of defaulting on a loan horrifies me beyond belief. I make enough money to pay all my bills just fine and still have money left over to do some &quot;fun&quot; things. This loan is simply for me to save a few dollars in interest. Rest assured, I am safe to lend to.<br/><br/>Thanks again for your consideration! Please feel free to ask any questions - I will answer them as quickly as I can.<br/>","Columbus, OH","","2 years"

I was not careless with my credit cards, but used them when I was out of work to pay the bills like mortgage, car, etc.  Before that happened, I had a few credit cards that had large balances on them due to unexpected travel expenses and medical expenses.  I was paying them down without a problem, but since I was out of work and had to use the others, it has become more and more difficult. Due to the large balances on the cards, the credit card companies have raised their fees and interest to a point where none of my payment is applied to the balances, just the fees.  If my payments had been applied to the balances, I would not be in such a desperate situation today.  <br/><br/>My salary should be enough to support my family and give them what they need.  It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating when most of my paycheck goes to the credit card companies each month and not even the balances.  I am a hard worker.  I have only been able to do patchwork repairs on our  house instead of large repairs that need to be done.  I need a large loan to wipe out this debt that I am drowning in plus have some extra to put into savings as a cushion for emergency medical expenses or repair bills, then I can build on that.  <br/><br/>I am extremely frustrated with my situation and have tried to get bank loans but have been condescendingly turned down due to the amount of debt.  One person even asked me why would anyone give me a loan to replace one debt with another.  I work 6 days a week.  My family sees how hard I work, and I know they sense how disappointed I am at times.  I want to set an example.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that all your hard work still doesn&rsquo;t get you ahead.  I don&rsquo;t want them to grow up thinking that if you are in a bind, nobody will help you.  They have continued to raise their percentage and fees and now minimum payments to the point that I am no longer able to make the minimum payments. I need help.  This loan would help my family from drowning in debt and get us back on our feet.  I would love to be able to have this hold on me gone.  I would also love to someday help somebody else out of debt as a thank you, since I know how it can affect every aspect of your life.  Thank you for reading my story, and thank you for helping.<br/>","Bangor, PA","","8 years"

It was a complete life saver AND a life changer.  The interest rate is 13.06%/16.69 APR.  I paid off my super high interest credit cards and now have zero balances and even canceled the least appealing card I had.  My credit was never bad as all my payments were always on time and over the minimum, but I was never able to make much progress with reducing the balances due to the high interest rates.  It was a blessing to be able to pay them off in one shot.  Now that I have an excellent payment history with Lending Club, I was offered to re-finance this loan at a much lower interest rate.   This is a truly unexpected surprise and I count myself very fortunate to have this offer.  So, I&rsquo;m gonna go for it!!
