I have successfully paid off other credit cards  that didn't have as high of interest rates. I generally  used all these credit cards to live while I was in college taking unpaid internships. I have not had any need to use the credit cards since I graduated. The only time I was late on my payments in the past 3 years was when a tornado hit our house. I was distracted and forgot to pay a number of things that month.  I believe my credit score is between 675-700."

My business has reached the Platinum Powerseller level on eBay and my sales are ranked in the top 5 of all sellers on eBay that offer similar products. With this loan I intend to expand my product selection.  The business model I have implemented on eBay is one that has allowed me to develop a niche market amongst other bead sellers. The type of beads I sell are sold by color and weight. The typical business sells these beads in a package that requires a minimum amount of each color. This can cause a customer to be forced to purchase much more than they would typically need to finish a project. For example
